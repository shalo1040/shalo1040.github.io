Normally, multiplication between two matrices is noncommutative. Therefore, algebra formulas(곱셈공식) and factorizations(인수분해) cannot perfom beteween them. However, there are some cases that we can perform algebra formulas and factorizations if one of two matrices is an identity matrix, E. Therefore, _AE = EA = A_

Let's say _AE = A_ where _A_ is a matrix and _E_ is an identity matrix. If we can multiply both sides by inverse of _A_, that is _1/A_, the result will be _1/A * AE = 1/A * A = E_. Therefore, we can see that _A * 1/A = E_.

We can notate inverse of matrix _A_ as _A_<sup>-1</sup>.
