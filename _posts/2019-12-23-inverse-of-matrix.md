Normally, multiplication between two matrices is noncommutative. Therefore, algebra formulas(곱셈공식) and factorizations(인수분해) cannot perfom beteween them. However, there are some cases that we can perform algebra formulas and factorizations if one of two matrices is an identity matrix, E. Therefore, $AE = EA = A$

Let's say $AE = A$ where $A$ is a matrix and $E$ is an identity matrix. If we can multiply both sides by inverse of $A$, that is $\frac{1}{A}$, the result will be $\frac{1}{A} * AE = \frac{1}{A} * A = E$. Therefore, we can see that $A * \frac{1}{A} = E$.

We can notate inverse of matrix $A$ as $A^{-1}$.
