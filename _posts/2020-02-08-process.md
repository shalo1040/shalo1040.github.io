### What is Process?
A process is a program that is currently running. It is also called a 'job'. It is different from a program, which is a passive entity that is just stored on disk space, unlike a process which is an active entity. A process includes program code, registers' information, stack, data, heap as shown in the picture below(which is in logical address).

### Process State
There are five different states of processes that are **new, ready, running, waiting, ** and **terminated**. A process's state is **new** when it is being created, **ready** when it is waiting to use CPU, **running** when it is using CPU, **waiting** when there is an event or interrupt such as I/O or system calls, and **terminated** when it has finished execution.

### PCB(Process Cotrol Block)
PCB is a data structure containing information of a particular process. It stores information such as **program state** which we've seen above, **program counter** which indicates the address of the next execution, and **CPU registers** that is the latest information of all registers which was used by a process when it was executed. It also saves **CPU-scheduling information** which includes a process priority, pointer information, and so on. **Memory-management information** section stores the information of base and limiit registers that indicates the range of the memory space of the process, segment tables, and so on. **Accounting information** stores how much time did the process used CPU or was executed, and **I/O status information** indicates I/O devices that are allocated to the process or a list of open files.

### Context Switch(문맥교환)
When an interrupt or an event occurs, the system saves the current context to PCB which is currently using CPU and brings back the next PCB which is a process that needs to be executed. This task is called **context switch** and this process is drawn below. We can say that it is a waste of CPU because it does not do useful work during context switch, when both processes P<sub>0</sub> and P<sub>1</sub> are being _idle_ which is drawn in the graph below.

### Interprocess Communication
There are two types of process: _independent process_ and _cooperating process_. The former literally means a process that doesn't affect and can't be affected by other processes, and the latter includes all processes that interacts with other processes. To interact with others, they should have such rules for using memory space, so they require an _Interprocess Communication(IPC)_ mechanism: _message passing_ and _shared memory_ models. In a message passing system, a process sends message to a mailbox and one of the other processes receives the message from the mailbox. It can also name which mailbox to send the message so that the message can be sent to the specific process. Sending and receiving messages are able by system calls. On the other hand, a shared memory model is leterally sharing memory space with other processes, which first get the shared memory space by system call and access to the memory when they need. Communication between many processes needs careful operations, so we will learn about _process synchronization_ to deal with this problem in a few weeks.
