Let's say

![matrix01](/assets/images/matrix_01.PNG)

where A is 2x2 square matrix(이차 정사각행렬) and B is 3x2 matrix. All elements of matrix is real number. Usually we use i and j to indicate row and column.

## Addition
You can simply add numbers in the same position.

## Subtraction
You can simply subtract numbers in the same position.

## Multiply by k(실수배)
You can simply multiply each number by k where k is real number.

## Multiplication
You can do multiplication of matrix as following.

###Identity Matrix(단위행렬)
This matrix has all elements in diagnal where i = j value of 1 and others 0.
